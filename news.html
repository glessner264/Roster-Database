<h1 id="title">Football: Season of change for Big Spring</h1>



<h2 id="over3">October 11, 2012</h2>
<h2 id="pub">Published By: Christopher Hopkins, The Sentinel</h2>

 <p id="news_fixed"> At the time, it seemed like things went from bad to worse for the Big Spring football team.</p>
<br /> 
<p id="news_fixed">The Bulldogs had just dropped a heartbreaking game to Boiling Springs, 5-0, when they first learned that their head coach, Brent Stroh, would be taking a leave of absence from the team to take care of his daughter, who was previously diagnosed with an undisclosed illness.</p>
<br /> 
<p id="news_fixed">While it came as a shock to all the Big Spring players, they didn’t have any time to sit and dwell on Stroh’s decision.</p>
<br /> 
<p id="news_fixed">They had just 10 minutes to get ready for practice.</p>
<br /> 
<p id="news_fixed">“Coach Stroh met with them and after, we just said ‘OK, be out for practice in 10 minutes,” said Michael Berry, who was put in place as a co-head coach of the Bulldogs after Stroh’s decision. “We went through the regular practice then talked to the kids afterward about what was going on, what our expectations were.”</p>
<br /> 
<p id="news_fixed">When Stroh made his decision to step down, Berry and assistant Bob Baker were chosen as co-head coaches to lead the Bulldogs for the remainder of the season. At the time, Berry was the head JV coach and Baker was the varsity defensive coordinator. While the decision came as much of a surprise to the coaches as it did players, the two were willing to step in and take charge.</p>
