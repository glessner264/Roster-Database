<h1 id="title">Mike Berry named new head coach at Big Spring</h1>



<h2 id="over3">January 22nd, 2013</h2>
<h2 id="pub">Published By: Christopher Hopkins, The Sentinel</h2>

 
 
 
<p id="news_fixed"> After taking over as a co-head coach for the Big Spring football team last fall, Mike Berry has now been officially named the new varsity head football coach of the Bulldogs.</p>
 <br />

<p id="news_fixed">Berry, 25, first got word last week that a committee of five people had chosen him and the position was his. Then, when the school board approved that decision Monday night, the Bishop McDevitt grad was officially the head coach.</p>
 <br />

<p id="news_fixed">“He really stood out because it’s important to have a coach in house,” Big Spring athletic director Jay Hockenbroch said. “He works great with kids. He will really be able to help us get the numbers up in the program. We are excited about his knowledge of football being a graduate of Bishop McDevitt.”</p>
 <br />

<p id="news_fixed">Berry got his first taste of coaching at the varsity level last year when he, along with Bob Baker, took over as co-head coaches after former coach Brent Stroh took a leave of absence. Prior to that, he had been the head JV coach at Big Spring.</p>
